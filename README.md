# WaterCube

An interactive SPH water simulation using Cinder.

## Setup

The simplest way to get started is to download cinder 0.9.1 from the [download page](https://libcinder.org/download).

Works on [Mac](https://libcinder.org/docs/guides/mac-setup/index.html) or [Windows](https://libcinder.org/docs/guides/windows-setup/index.html).

Once the project is cloned:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `CINDER_PATH` in `.env` to the path to your cinder installation.
